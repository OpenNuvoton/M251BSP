    "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
    that each register maintains its expected value for the lifetime of the
    task.  Each task uses a different set of values.  The reg test tasks execute
    with a very low priority, so get preempted very frequently.  A register
    containing an unexpected value is indicative of an error in the context
    switching mechanism.
